Custom printf Function

Project Description:

This project is an implementation of a custom printf function, named _printf, that mimics the standard printf function from the C standard library. The goal of this project is to understand the variadic functions in C and how to use them by recreating a basic version of the printf function that can handle various formats (%c, %s, %d, %i, %u, %o, %x, %X, %p, %%).

Our _printf function is designed to provide a simplified way to output information to the standard output, similar to the original printf function, with support for various data types and the ability to print custom data formats.
